<h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Elvin Carias. I currently live in the wonderful village of San Roman which is located in the Corozal District.
        I enjoy exploring places and capturing moments through photos. One of my favorite hobbies is taking pictures while traveling or hanging out with friends. 
        I like being social, talking with people, and matching the energy and vibe around me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose tourism because it allows me to connect with people easily and learn about different lifestyles, cultures, and destinations. 
        It also gives me the opportunity to help others enjoy their travel experiences while creating memories of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Career Goal:</strong> I do not have anything written in stone yet because I believe life can take you in many directions. 
        I trust that God has a plan for me and I am open to opportunities that help me grow, travel more, and succeed in the future.
    </p>
